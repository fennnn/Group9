/* filename: userInterface.cpp
* Programmers: Matthew Greenlaw, (Add your name here)
* Class Number: CS-300
* Date: 22NOV17
* Purpose:The User Interface (UI) class manages all input from the user and all
  output to the user, as well as enforcing the proper access levels for each
  user. This entails providing the user with menuâ€™s, accepting their
  selections/data, and passing this data on to other classes to consume. The UI
  class will also query deeper level classes (such as the Account Manager or
  Report Manager) in order to provide information to the user, if the user
  selects a menu option that requires such action. The UI class will utilize the
  Warden class to determine the security clearance of each user and will present
  menu options to them based on that clearance.
